I will perform the following steps to commit your changes locally:

1.  **Stage Changes**: Run `git add .` to stage all modified files (specifically `script.js` which contains the recent UI and animation updates).
2.  **Commit**: Run `git commit -m "Update lottery UI with minimalist design and animations"` to save the changes to your local history.

This will not push any code to the remote repository.
